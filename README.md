# kaulakys

kaulakys.pro - library of codes to calculate cross sections and rate coefficients for inelastic collisions with hydrogen atoms according to the free electron model of Kaulakys (1986, 1991).  Written in IDL.

Two examples of how one might use the code are provided in Li_kaul.pro and Na_kaul.pro and the results I obtained are in kaul_Li.txt and kaul_Na.txt.  Various other tests in test_kaulakys.pro and test.pro.

The code depends on mswavef/mswavef.pro and libpub/integ_rate.pro
